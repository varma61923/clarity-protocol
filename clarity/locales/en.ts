    q1: "What is CLARITY's core mission?",
    a1: 'To empower verified journalists to publish immutable, anonymous, multilingual news using decentralized infrastructure, prioritizing privacy and verifiability without surveillance or paywalls.',
    q2: 'How does it resist censorship?',
    a2: 'Content is stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and anchored to a blockchain. This makes it permanent and removes single points of failure, making it extremely difficult for any single entity to remove content.',
    q3: 'How is journalist anonymity protected?',
    a3: "Authors use wallet-based authentication and can be verified through optional, privacy-preserving zk-KYC (Zero-Knowledge Know Your Customer) and Soulbound Tokens (SBTs), proving their credentials without revealing their real-world identity.",
    q4: 'What is the role of the DAO?',
    a4: 'The CLARITY DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) governs the protocol. Community members can vote on proposals, including resolving disputes over flagged articles, ensuring community-led moderation and evolution of the platform.',

    'zk-KYC': "Zero-Knowledge Know Your Customer is a privacy-preserving method to verify a user's identity without revealing the underlying personal data to the verifier.",
    'SBTs': "Soulbound Tokens are non-transferable tokens that represent a person's identity, credentials, or affiliations on the blockchain. They cannot be sold or given away.",
    'blockchain': 'A distributed, immutable ledger that records transactions and tracks assets in a business network. It is the core technology behind most cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications.',
